# etcd_check
This is a simple etcd check, it's intended to verify if all endpoints are ok, and it's usefull to better understand ETCD api :)

# ETCD server setup

It's useful to have an _ETCD_ server to test the sw. In this repo you'll find some useful (and very "stupid") scripts to run a dummy _ETCD_ cluster with _TLS_ enabled on docker.

Please *DO NOT USE* this scripts in production.
